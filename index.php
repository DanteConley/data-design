			<b><u>Use Case</u></b>
		</header>

		<p>
			Dylan has just finished up a new "fire" EP. He needs to share it with his growing fan
			base and also get his music to the ears of new possible fans. Dylan double checks that
			he is happy with the mastered tracks on Ableton, he thinks they're "lit", so he exports
			the files to his desktop as lossless .wav files. He proceeds to log into SoundCloud and
			upload his new music along with some "trippy" album artwork his "homie" made. Knowing
			his tunes are "Dank" he sits back and waits for the numerous e-mails filled with "mad
			props" and booking requests to pour into his inbox. They do. And he is totally "stoked".
